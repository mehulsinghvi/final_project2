## Final Project Proposal
### Pong arcade game

- What project you want to do

The game is designed for two players and they will each have a simple "paddle" (bar) to hit the ball on both sides that can be moved on a vertical slider using the keyboard arrow keys. The scores will be updated based on if the opponent misses the shot. Advanced features could be changing the background of the game canvas and changing the ball size and speed.
More than one ball is supported in this game to make it more challenging.

- What background knowledge do you have on this kind of project, and why do you want to do this project? (Put another way, in what way will you be motivated to see this project to completion?)

I had fun doing the Ideal Gas Simulation project and wanted to do something similar but in a game form that plays with collision logic etc


- A rough timeline of what will get accomplished and when (e.g, "By the end of Week 2, I will have implemented XYZ and will start working on ABC")

End of week 1: I want to have the logic of the game implemented. This entails having the paddle collision logic, and game boundaries, wall collisions etc

End of week 2: I want to finish implementing the game canvas, and the keyboard control features.

End of week 3: Implement the advanced features like changing the game canvas features and personalizing them. Also, work on saving the scores for future use in an external file and loading it for future games (saving game progress).

- If you were to finish the project early, what extra "stretch goals" could you implement?

If I have more time, I'll try making it a four-player game!
